,,descrition,Provide a brief description of the sampling method,"""We conducted the sea trials over three consecutive fishing seasons: the January–March 2019 winter season, the October–December 2019 fall season, and the January–March 2020 winter season. The fishing trials were conducted under commercial fishing conditions on board the coastal gillnetter “MS Karoline” (10.9 m overall length). The fishing grounds were located off the coast of Troms (Northern Norway) around 69°55′–70°22′N and 19°39′–21°05′E, which is a frequently used fishing ground for coastal vessels from this region."""
